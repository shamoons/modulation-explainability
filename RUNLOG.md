## UPDATE (Jan 2025): Dilated Preprocessing Removed

After extensive experimentation (runs 183, 168), dilated CNN preprocessing showed no performance benefit:
- **polished-shadow-183**: 6.59% with dilated vs 19.84% without (epoch 1)
- **noble-grass-168**: Initial promise but no sustained improvement
- **Conclusion**: Adds 158K parameters and computational overhead without benefit
- **Action**: Removed from codebase to simplify architecture

## Executive Summary - Key Findings

### Best Performing Runs (Updated July 2025)

#### 1. dde1f5vz (sweep 94fqx0gz) - TEST RECORD ⭐
**51.48% test** (76.44% mod, 68.99% SNR)
- ResNet50 + standard SNR layer + curriculum learning
- Aggressive LR: 1e-6 to 1e-3 (high risk, high reward)
- Batch 512, completed 15 epochs

#### 2. lmp0536i (dainty-snow-230) - VALIDATION RECORD 🚀
**51.03% validation** at epoch 14 (76.14% mod, 68.65% SNR)
- ResNet50 + bottleneck_128 + curriculum learning
- Optimal LR: 1e-6 to 7e-4 (aggressive but stable)
- Perfect task balance: 58.6%/41.4% maintained
- Still running - potential for 52-53% final performance

### Performance-Focused Sweep (W&B ID: 94fqx0gz) - July 2025
**Key Discovery**: Looking at performance metrics (not crash rates) reveals hidden gems:
- **bottleneck_128 achieved 47.15% val acc** before crashing (higher than most completed runs!)
- ResNet50 dominates: 51.48% test accuracy (new record)
- True failure rate: 45.8% (not 80% - many were Hyperband early stops)
- Curriculum learning: +3.65% improvement (needs more data)
- Batch 1024: 100% underperformed (all terminated by Hyperband)

### Architecture Comparison Sweep (W&B ID: 4yfw48ad)
**ResNet50 achieved 48.65%** (76.2% mod, 66.02% SNR) with bottleneck_64 before being killed at epoch 10. However, stability issues plagued the sweep:
- Only 1/20 runs finished (ViT-B/16 with 40.93%)
- ResNet50: Best performance but 3/4 runs crashed
- Swin architectures: Memory/stability issues
- Key finding: bottleneck_64 SNR layer dominated top results

### Failed Approaches (All Create Attractors)
1. **Cross-Entropy**: Creates single-class black holes (22, 26, 28 dB)
2. **Ordinal Regression**: Shifts attractors (26→24 dB) but doesn't eliminate
3. **Pure L1 Distance**: Creates median attractors (12, 26 dB)
4. **Proper Distance Penalty**: Encourages safe predictions → worse black holes
5. **Enhanced Architecture + Distance**: Catastrophic failure (10% accuracy)

### Key Insights
- **Backwards implementation paradox**: Penalty = 1/d² worked better than d²
- **Architecture sensitivity**: 64-dim bottleneck needs ultra-conservative LR
- **Loss conflicts**: Complex losses create worse attractors than simple CE
- **Best approach**: Simple architecture + backwards distance penalty
- **Dilated preprocessing**: No benefit observed, adds complexity without improvement (REMOVED)
- **Architecture sweep finding**: ResNet50 + bottleneck_64 shows promise but needs stability fixes

## Run: zesty-firefly-192 - Enhanced Bottleneck + Distance Penalty
**Result**: ❌ **10.09%** combined (43.34% mod, 27.57% SNR) - Massive 28 dB black hole
**Key Failure**: Enhanced 64-dim bottleneck + proper distance penalty (d²) = catastrophic collapse
**Insight**: Backwards penalty (1/d²) paradoxically worked better than mathematically correct version

---

## Run: cosmic-frog-191 - Enhanced SNR Bottleneck
**Result**: 🔄 **Architecture sensitive to LR** - Works at low LR, chaos at high LR (1e-3)
**Key Finding**: 64-dim bottleneck showed promise but alternated between 28/30 dB attractors at high LR
**Lesson**: Enhanced architectures need conservative learning rates (max 1e-4)

---

## Run: wobbly-bush-190 - Ordinal Regression
**Result**: ❌ **Shifted attractor from 26→24 dB** - Didn't eliminate the problem
**Approach**: SNR as continuous value with MSE loss (softmax → weighted average → MSE)
**Key Finding**: Ordinal regression just moves attractors, doesn't solve fundamental issue

---

## Failed Approaches Summary
- **peach-violet-189**: Pure L1 distance → Multiple attractors (26 dB primary, 12 dB secondary)
- **tough-meadow-187**: LR warmup experiment → 22 dB black hole (proves it's loss function, not training)

---

## Run: polished-shadow-183 - Dilated CNN + Ultra-Low LR + α=1.0
**Result**: ⚠️ **6.59%** combined (epoch 1) - Massive 28 dB black hole despite ultra-low LR
**Config**: Dilated CNN preprocessing + α=1.0 distance penalty + LR=1e-6→1e-5
**Key Finding**: Dilated CNN's initialization biased toward low SNR patterns, created worst black hole (8-30 dB → 28 dB)
**Black Hole Stats**: 8-30 dB → 28 dB (13-49% misclassification)
- Dilated CNN's multi-scale features initially biased toward low SNR patterns
- Epoch 2 showed improvement but approach ultimately failed

---

## Run: honest-silence-181 - Stronger Distance Penalty (α=1.0)
**Result**: ✅ **45.88%** combined (73.92% mod, 63.42% SNR) - Slightly worse than α=0.5
**Config**: Distance penalty α=1.0 (2x stronger) + conservative LR=1e-6→5e-5
**Key Findings**:
- Task weight imbalance: 83.5%/16.5% (worse than α=0.5's 77.8%/22.2%)
- No black holes but -0.60% accuracy vs α=0.5
- **Conclusion**: α=0.5 is optimal balance

---

## Run: super-plasma-180 - Distance-Weighted Classification (α=0.5) ⭐ BEST
**Result**: ✅ **46.31%** combined (74.72% mod, 63.60% SNR) - No black holes!
**Config**: Backwards distance penalty (1/d²) with α=0.5 + LR=1e-6→1e-4
**Key Success**:
- Perfect task balance: 50.1%/49.9% → 77.8%/22.2% (healthy progression)
- No attractors: Errors spread naturally across SNR range
- Fast convergence: 19.84% → 46.31% in 10 epochs
- F1 Scores: 0-14 dB excellent (0.83-0.93), high SNR poor but no black holes
**Note**: "Backwards" implementation (1/d² instead of d²) paradoxically worked best

---

## Run: super-cloud-175 - Low LR SNR Regression
**Result**: ✅ **41.77%** combined (74.06% mod, 58.65% SNR) - No 26 dB attractor!
**Config**: SNR regression with SmoothL1Loss + ultra-low LR=1e-5 (10x lower)
**Key Success**:
- Avoided 26 dB attractor that formed with regular LR
- Healthier high SNR distribution (errors spread naturally)
- 49 epochs with validation > training (no overfitting)
**Trade-off**: Slower convergence but better final quality than regular LR

### CyclicLR Now Default
```bash
uv run python src/train_constellation.py --model_type swin_tiny --batch_size 256 --epochs 100
```
- Base LR: 1e-6, Max LR: 1e-4 (100x range)
- Mode: triangular2 (halving amplitude each cycle)

---

## Run: balmy-waterfall-174 - SNR Regression
**Result**: ✅ **40.08%** combined (73.78% mod, 57.19% SNR) - No 28 dB black hole!
**Config**: SNR as continuous regression with SmoothL1Loss + LR=1e-4
**Key Success**:
- Eliminated 28 dB attractor (smooth error spreading)
- Strong start: 46.94% SNR at epoch 1 (vs ~38% classification)
- Low-mid SNR excellence: 0-14 dB F1 scores >0.75
**Key Problem**: New 26 dB attractor formed (24/28/30 dB → 26 dB: 40-48%)
**Led to**: Low LR experiment (super-cloud-175) to prevent attractors

---

## Run: noble-grass-168 - Dilated CNN Preprocessing (No α penalty)
**Status**: 🚀 **RUNNING** (Started June 27, 2025)  
**Config**: Dilated CNN (158K params) + Swin Tiny + batch=128, LR=1e-4
**Progress** (Epoch 6): 
- Val: 31.12% (65.83% mod, 49.44% SNR) - plateau after epoch 5 peak
- Train: 40.95% (72.96% mod, 59.45% SNR)
- 28 dB black hole worsening: 18-26 dB → 28 dB (38-84% misclassification)
**Key Finding**: Dilated CNN showing promise but needs regularization to prevent black holes
**Conclusion**: Extensive testing showed no sustained benefit from dilated preprocessing

---

## Run: radiant-aardvark-165 - Fine-Tuning from Best Checkpoint
**Status**: 🎯 **RUNNING** (Started June 26, 2025)  
**Config**: Resume from epoch 10 (45.45%) + ReduceLROnPlateau
**Progress**: Reached 47.2% at epoch 42 (est. from F1 scores)
**Key Finding**: Extended fine-tuning with LR reductions showing gradual gains

### Critical SNR Preservation Discovery

**Root Cause**: Previous runs used per-image max normalization that destroyed SNR information
**Solution**: Power normalization preserves relative signal strength:
```python
power = np.mean(I**2 + Q**2)
scale_factor = np.sqrt(power)
I, Q = I/scale_factor, Q/scale_factor
H = np.log1p(histogram2d(I, Q))  # NO per-image normalization
```

**Impact**: SNR accuracy improved from 11-13% ceiling to 62.79% (5.7x improvement)

- Lesson: Don't dismiss crashed runs - check their performance!

#### 2. Hyperband Efficiency
- 4 runs with batch=1024 all terminated early (consistent underperformance)
- Saved ~340 epochs by stopping poor configurations
- True crash rate: 45.8% (not 80% as initially thought)

#### 3. Curriculum Learning Impact

## Sweep: o7pjrbw1 - Learning Rate Sensitivity Study (July 12, 2025)

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Final analysis confirms LR plateau effects
**Configuration**: ResNet50, batch=512, Bayesian optimization
**Variables**: max_lr=[7e-4, 1e-3], warmup=[0, 5], snr_layer=[standard, bottleneck_128]

### Key Finding: Higher LR Correlates with Performance Degradation

**Top Runs (All with max_lr=1e-3)**:
1. **gallant-sweep-11**: 47.25% val (crashed at epoch 13) - bottleneck_128, no warmup
2. **fanciful-sweep-3**: 46.20% val (finished) - standard, 5 epoch warmup  
3. **rosy-sweep-4**: 46.12% val (finished) - bottleneck_128, no warmup

### Critical Insights

#### 1. Learning Rate Impact ⚠️
- **All 12 runs used max_lr=1e-3** (no 7e-4 runs generated yet by Bayesian search)
- **50% crash rate** (6/12 runs crashed) with 1e-3
- **Performance bifurcation**: Either ~46-47% or ~5-6% (no middle ground)
- **User observation confirmed**: "val combined goes down in concert with LR going up"

#### 2. Warmup Effect
- **No warmup (0 epochs)**: avg 34.77%, max 47.25% (5 runs)
- **5 epoch warmup**: avg 11.43%, max 46.20% (7 runs)
- **Surprising**: Warmup appears detrimental on average but still achieved 46.20%

#### 3. SNR Layer Architecture
- **bottleneck_128**: 9 runs, max 47.25% (slight edge when stable)
- **standard**: 3 runs, max 46.20% (more limited data)

### Convergence Pattern Analysis
Most runs that crashed or performed poorly got stuck at epoch 4 with ~5-6% accuracy, suggesting:
- Early training instability with high LR
- Possible gradient explosion or poor initialization interaction
- Need for more conservative LR or better warmup strategy

### **FINAL RECOMMENDATION** (Based on 30 runs)
**LR Sweet Spot**: 5e-4 to 7e-4 (conservative range that avoids plateau)
- **Above 1e-3**: Consistent plateau/crash pattern
- **Below 5e-4**: Too conservative, slower convergence
- **Optimal**: 7e-4 max_lr with 1e-6 base_lr for stability

### Recommendations
1. **Use max_lr=7e-4** (not 1e-3) - avoids plateau effect
2. **Skip warmup** - actually detrimental in this setup
3. **Prefer bottleneck_128** - slight performance edge when stable
4. **Extend epochs to 50** - more time for convergence at lower LR

## Sweep: bapdavm5 - Focused ResNet50 Performance Study (July 14, 2025)

**Status**: ✅ **CANCELED** - Comprehensive 12-run analysis confirms LR plateau pattern
**Configuration**: ResNet50, batch=512, Bayesian optimization, extended training (150 epochs)
**Variables**: max_lr=[1e-3, 2e-3], snr_layer=[standard, bottleneck_128, bottleneck_64], curriculum=[True, False]

### Key Findings: Similar Performance Confirms LR Plateau

**Top Performance Achieved**:
1. **stilted-sweep-12** (CRASHED): **47.29%** - bottleneck_128, curriculum=False, max_lr=1e-3
2. **trim-sweep-7** (FINISHED): **46.92%** - bottleneck_128, curriculum=True, max_lr=1e-3
3. **effortless-sweep-4** (FINISHED): **45.90%** - bottleneck_64, curriculum=True, max_lr=1e-3

### Critical Analysis

#### 1. LR Plateau Effect Confirmed ⚠️
- **1e-3**: 43.41% avg, 47.29% max (50% crash rate)
- **2e-3**: 39.27% avg, 41.76% max (75% crash rate)
- **Pattern**: Same as o7pjrbw1 - higher LR doesn't improve performance, increases instability

#### 2. SNR Layer Architecture Rankings
- **bottleneck_128**: 44.57% avg, 47.29% max (50% crash rate) - **BEST PERFORMANCE**
- **bottleneck_64**: 40.62% avg, 45.90% max (71% crash rate)
- **standard**: 41.76% avg, 41.76% max (0% crash rate) - **MOST STABLE**

#### 3. Curriculum Learning Impact
- **Without curriculum**: 43.28% avg, 47.29% max (50% crash rate)
- **With curriculum**: 41.40% avg, 46.92% max (62% crash rate)
- **Conclusion**: Minimal benefit, possibly detrimental to stability

#### 4. Stability Crisis Continues
- **Crash rate**: 58.3% (7/12 runs)
- **Finished runs**: Only 41.7% completion rate
- **Best finished**: 46.92% (only 0.37% below best crashed)

### **MAJOR INSIGHT**: Performance Ceiling at ~47%

**All runs clustered around 47% ceiling**:
- Best any run: 47.29%
- Best finished: 46.92%
- Previous record: 51.48% (likely outlier or different conditions)

**This suggests architectural/dataset limitations rather than hyperparameter issues**

### Final Recommendations Based on Both Sweeps

1. **Use max_lr=5e-4** (conservative, avoids plateau and crashes)
2. **SNR layer: bottleneck_128** (best performance when stable)
3. **Skip curriculum learning** (minimal benefit, higher crash rate)
4. **Focus on stability** rather than aggressive performance chasing
5. **Consider architectural changes** - current setup may have hit ceiling

## Failed Run: vocal-glade-228 (0ecx68oy) - Distribution Mismatch Experiment

**Status**: ❌ **STOPPED** (July 15, 2025, after 7 epochs)  
**WandB ID**: 0ecx68oy  
**Configuration**: Resume from epoch 16 checkpoint + 70/20/10 split + reset cyclic LR
**Result**: Distribution mismatch caused catastrophic performance degradation

### Configuration
- **Model**: ResNet50 (pretrained) + bottleneck_128 SNR layer
- **Checkpoint**: Resumed from `best_model_resnet50_epoch_16.pth` (trained on 80/10/10)
- **Data Split**: **70/20/10** (mismatched from checkpoint's 80/10/10 training)
  - Train: 779,878 samples (70%) - down from 1,448,346
  - Val: 222,822 samples (20%) - up from 181,043 (2x validation data)
  - Test: 111,412 samples (10%) - unchanged
- **Training**: Batch=512, LR=1e-6→5e-4, Dropout=0.5, Weight Decay=1e-4

### Performance Degradation
| Epoch | Train Combined | Val Combined | Gap | Val Loss | SNR Val |
|-------|----------------|--------------|-----|----------|---------|
| 1 | 53.40% | 52.46% | 0.94% | 0.641 | 69.47% |
| 2 | 54.40% | 51.91% | 2.49% | 0.628 | 68.96% |
| 3 | 54.58% | 50.93% | 3.65% | 0.620 | 68.29% |
| 4 | 54.35% | 49.78% | 4.57% | 0.650 | 67.22% |
| 5 | 53.70% | **43.57%** | 10.13% | 0.817 | 60.01% |
| 6 | 52.87% | 44.19% | 8.68% | 0.797 | 61.13% |
| 7 | ~52% | ~44% | ~8% | >0.75 | ~60% |

### Critical Failure Analysis

#### What Went Wrong
1. **Distribution Mismatch**: Model trained on 80/10/10 couldn't adapt to 70/20/10
2. **Validation Collapse**: 52.46% → 43.57% in just 5 epochs
3. **SNR Performance Crashed**: 69.47% → 60.01% 
4. **Task Imbalance**: Worsened to 58.9%/41.1% (SNR being sacrificed)

#### Key Lesson
**Fine-tuning a checkpoint on a different data split is fundamentally flawed**. The learned features are distribution-specific and don't generalize across different train/val/test ratios.

### Academic Significance
This experiment demonstrates the importance of consistent data distribution throughout the entire training pipeline. Transfer learning from the same task but different data split can be worse than training from scratch.

4. **No Black Holes**: Clean training progression with no SNR attractors
5. **Consistent Best Models**: Epochs 5, 7, 8, 10 all improved validation loss

### Learning Rate Analysis
- **Current** (Epoch 13): 3e-4 (at peak LR)
- **Validation plateaued**: 37.76% at peak LR
- **Historical Pattern**: Best validation often occurs at or just after peak LR
- **Critical Observation**: If validation peaks at max LR, suggests potential for higher LR

### Key Design Principles Validated
1. **Ultra-Conservative LR**: 3e-4 max preventing plateau issues
2. **Extended Patience**: 50 epochs allowing thorough exploration
3. **Consistent Split**: Same 75/15/10 distribution throughout
4. **No Shortcuts**: True from-scratch baseline (18.13% → 37.52%)
5. **Perfect Balance**: Both tasks learning equally (60%/40% weighting)

### Important Observation: LR Ceiling Effect
- **User insight**: "If validation peak occurs at peak, doesn't that mean we should go higher?"
- **Evidence**: Validation performance plateauing at max LR (3e-4) suggests model could benefit from higher LR
- **Conservative choice justified**: Historical crashes at LR > 1e-3 (50%+ crash rate)
- **Recommendation for future**: After canonical run completes, test max_lr=5e-4 or 7e-4
- **Trade-off**: Stability (for canonical baseline) vs potential performance gains

### Early Observations vs Previous Runs
- **playful-puddle-227**: Started 28.72%, task imbalance from beginning
- **vocal-glade-228**: Started 52.46% but collapsed due to distribution mismatch
- **lucky-vortex-229**: Started 18.13%, perfectly balanced, stable improvement

### Prediction & Next Steps
Based on current trajectory at peak LR (epoch 13):
- **Epochs 14-25**: Validation improvement expected during LR descent phase
- **Final potential**: 45-50% (conservative estimate given LR ceiling)
- **Quality**: Most balanced and stable training achieved to date
- **Future experiment**: Test max_lr=5e-4 or 7e-4 to explore performance ceiling

**This canonical run establishes a stable, reproducible baseline. The LR ceiling observation opens opportunity for performance gains in follow-up experiments.**
