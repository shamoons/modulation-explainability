## UPDATE (Jan 2025): Dilated Preprocessing Removed

After extensive experimentation (runs 183, 168), dilated CNN preprocessing showed no performance benefit:
- **polished-shadow-183**: 6.59% with dilated vs 19.84% without (epoch 1)
- **noble-grass-168**: Initial promise but no sustained improvement
- **Conclusion**: Adds 158K parameters and computational overhead without benefit
- **Action**: Removed from codebase to simplify architecture

## Executive Summary - Key Findings

### Best Performing Run
**super-plasma-180**: 46.31% combined (74.72% mod, 63.60% SNR)
- Standard architecture + **backwards** distance penalty (1/d²)
- Conservative LR range: 1e-6 to 1e-4
- No black holes, healthy SNR distribution

### Architecture Comparison Sweep (W&B ID: 4yfw48ad)
**ResNet50 achieved 48.65%** (76.2% mod, 66.02% SNR) with bottleneck_64 before being killed at epoch 10. However, stability issues plagued the sweep:
- Only 1/20 runs finished (ViT-B/16 with 40.93%)
- ResNet50: Best performance but 3/4 runs crashed
- Swin architectures: Memory/stability issues
- Key finding: bottleneck_64 SNR layer dominated top results

### Failed Approaches (All Create Attractors)
1. **Cross-Entropy**: Creates single-class black holes (22, 26, 28 dB)
2. **Ordinal Regression**: Shifts attractors (26→24 dB) but doesn't eliminate
3. **Pure L1 Distance**: Creates median attractors (12, 26 dB)
4. **Proper Distance Penalty**: Encourages safe predictions → worse black holes
5. **Enhanced Architecture + Distance**: Catastrophic failure (10% accuracy)

### Key Insights
- **Backwards implementation paradox**: Penalty = 1/d² worked better than d²
- **Architecture sensitivity**: 64-dim bottleneck needs ultra-conservative LR
- **Loss conflicts**: Complex losses create worse attractors than simple CE
- **Best approach**: Simple architecture + backwards distance penalty
- **Dilated preprocessing**: No benefit observed, adds complexity without improvement (REMOVED)
- **Architecture sweep finding**: ResNet50 + bottleneck_64 shows promise but needs stability fixes

## Run: zesty-firefly-192 - Enhanced Bottleneck + Distance Penalty
**Result**: ❌ **10.09%** combined (43.34% mod, 27.57% SNR) - Massive 28 dB black hole
**Key Failure**: Enhanced 64-dim bottleneck + proper distance penalty (d²) = catastrophic collapse
**Insight**: Backwards penalty (1/d²) paradoxically worked better than mathematically correct version

---

## Run: cosmic-frog-191 - Enhanced SNR Bottleneck
**Result**: 🔄 **Architecture sensitive to LR** - Works at low LR, chaos at high LR (1e-3)
**Key Finding**: 64-dim bottleneck showed promise but alternated between 28/30 dB attractors at high LR
**Lesson**: Enhanced architectures need conservative learning rates (max 1e-4)

---

## Run: wobbly-bush-190 - Ordinal Regression
**Result**: ❌ **Shifted attractor from 26→24 dB** - Didn't eliminate the problem
**Approach**: SNR as continuous value with MSE loss (softmax → weighted average → MSE)
**Key Finding**: Ordinal regression just moves attractors, doesn't solve fundamental issue

---

## Failed Approaches Summary
- **peach-violet-189**: Pure L1 distance → Multiple attractors (26 dB primary, 12 dB secondary)
- **tough-meadow-187**: LR warmup experiment → 22 dB black hole (proves it's loss function, not training)

---

## Run: polished-shadow-183 - Dilated CNN + Ultra-Low LR + α=1.0
**Result**: ⚠️ **6.59%** combined (epoch 1) - Massive 28 dB black hole despite ultra-low LR
**Config**: Dilated CNN preprocessing + α=1.0 distance penalty + LR=1e-6→1e-5
**Key Finding**: Dilated CNN's initialization biased toward low SNR patterns, created worst black hole (8-30 dB → 28 dB)
**Black Hole Stats**: 8-30 dB → 28 dB (13-49% misclassification)
- Dilated CNN's multi-scale features initially biased toward low SNR patterns
- Epoch 2 showed improvement but approach ultimately failed

---

## Run: honest-silence-181 - Stronger Distance Penalty (α=1.0)
**Result**: ✅ **45.88%** combined (73.92% mod, 63.42% SNR) - Slightly worse than α=0.5
**Config**: Distance penalty α=1.0 (2x stronger) + conservative LR=1e-6→5e-5
**Key Findings**:
- Task weight imbalance: 83.5%/16.5% (worse than α=0.5's 77.8%/22.2%)
- No black holes but -0.60% accuracy vs α=0.5
- **Conclusion**: α=0.5 is optimal balance

---

## Run: super-plasma-180 - Distance-Weighted Classification (α=0.5) ⭐ BEST
**Result**: ✅ **46.31%** combined (74.72% mod, 63.60% SNR) - No black holes!
**Config**: Backwards distance penalty (1/d²) with α=0.5 + LR=1e-6→1e-4
**Key Success**:
- Perfect task balance: 50.1%/49.9% → 77.8%/22.2% (healthy progression)
- No attractors: Errors spread naturally across SNR range
- Fast convergence: 19.84% → 46.31% in 10 epochs
- F1 Scores: 0-14 dB excellent (0.83-0.93), high SNR poor but no black holes
**Note**: "Backwards" implementation (1/d² instead of d²) paradoxically worked best

---

## Run: super-cloud-175 - Low LR SNR Regression
**Result**: ✅ **41.77%** combined (74.06% mod, 58.65% SNR) - No 26 dB attractor!
**Config**: SNR regression with SmoothL1Loss + ultra-low LR=1e-5 (10x lower)
**Key Success**:
- Avoided 26 dB attractor that formed with regular LR
- Healthier high SNR distribution (errors spread naturally)
- 49 epochs with validation > training (no overfitting)
**Trade-off**: Slower convergence but better final quality than regular LR

### CyclicLR Now Default
```bash
uv run python src/train_constellation.py --model_type swin_tiny --batch_size 256 --epochs 100
```
- Base LR: 1e-6, Max LR: 1e-4 (100x range)
- Mode: triangular2 (halving amplitude each cycle)

---

## Run: balmy-waterfall-174 - SNR Regression
**Result**: ✅ **40.08%** combined (73.78% mod, 57.19% SNR) - No 28 dB black hole!
**Config**: SNR as continuous regression with SmoothL1Loss + LR=1e-4
**Key Success**:
- Eliminated 28 dB attractor (smooth error spreading)
- Strong start: 46.94% SNR at epoch 1 (vs ~38% classification)
- Low-mid SNR excellence: 0-14 dB F1 scores >0.75
**Key Problem**: New 26 dB attractor formed (24/28/30 dB → 26 dB: 40-48%)
**Led to**: Low LR experiment (super-cloud-175) to prevent attractors

---

## Run: noble-grass-168 - Dilated CNN Preprocessing (No α penalty)
**Status**: 🚀 **RUNNING** (Started June 27, 2025)  
**Config**: Dilated CNN (158K params) + Swin Tiny + batch=128, LR=1e-4
**Progress** (Epoch 6): 
- Val: 31.12% (65.83% mod, 49.44% SNR) - plateau after epoch 5 peak
- Train: 40.95% (72.96% mod, 59.45% SNR)
- 28 dB black hole worsening: 18-26 dB → 28 dB (38-84% misclassification)
**Key Finding**: Dilated CNN showing promise but needs regularization to prevent black holes
**Conclusion**: Extensive testing showed no sustained benefit from dilated preprocessing

---

## Run: radiant-aardvark-165 - Fine-Tuning from Best Checkpoint
**Status**: 🎯 **RUNNING** (Started June 26, 2025)  
**Config**: Resume from epoch 10 (45.45%) + ReduceLROnPlateau
**Progress**: Reached 47.2% at epoch 42 (est. from F1 scores)
**Key Finding**: Extended fine-tuning with LR reductions showing gradual gains

### Critical SNR Preservation Discovery

**Root Cause**: Previous runs used per-image max normalization that destroyed SNR information
**Solution**: Power normalization preserves relative signal strength:
```python
power = np.mean(I**2 + Q**2)
scale_factor = np.sqrt(power)
I, Q = I/scale_factor, Q/scale_factor
H = np.log1p(histogram2d(I, Q))  # NO per-image normalization
```

**Impact**: SNR accuracy improved from 11-13% ceiling to 62.79% (5.7x improvement)
