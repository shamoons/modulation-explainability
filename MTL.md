# Multi-Task Learning Implementation

## Current Approach

Our current implementation uses a shared backbone with task-specific heads and dynamic loss balancing based on Li et al. (2023):

```python
class DynamicLossBalancing(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_tasks, device):
        super().__init__()
        self.alpha = 0.3  # Moving average factor
        self.eps = 1e-8   # Numerical stability
        
        # Track moving averages of loss ratios
        self.register_buffer('loss_ratios', torch.ones(num_tasks, device=device))
        
    def forward(self, losses):
        # Update loss ratios with moving average
        loss_ratios = torch.tensor([loss.item() for loss in losses], device=self.device)
        self.loss_ratios = self.alpha * self.loss_ratios + (1 - self.alpha) * loss_ratios
        
        # Compute weights based on loss ratios
        weights = 1.0 / (self.loss_ratios + self.eps)
        weights = weights / weights.sum()
        
        # Apply weights to losses
        weighted_losses = [weights[i] * loss for i, loss in enumerate(losses)]
        return sum(weighted_losses)
```

### Architecture
1. **Shared Backbone**: ResNet-based feature extractor
2. **Shared Layers**: 
   - Linear transformation
   - ReLU activation
   - Batch normalization
   - Dropout
3. **Task-Specific Heads**:
   - Modulation classification head
   - SNR prediction head

### Strengths
- Efficient parameter sharing
- Dynamic loss balancing based on task difficulty
- Automatic weight adaptation
- Task-specific feature learning
- Moving average for stable weight updates

### Limitations
- Equal feature sharing might not be optimal
- Limited cross-task interaction
- Initial weights are equal (0.5/0.5)

## Previous Approaches

### 1. Static Loss Weighting
```python
total_loss = alpha * loss_modulation + beta * loss_snr
```
- Fixed weights throughout training
- No adaptation to task difficulty
- Manual tuning required

### 2. Dynamic Weighted Loss (Kendall et al., 2018)
Reference: [Multi-Task Learning Using Uncertainty to Weigh Losses for Scene Geometry and Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07115)

Implementation approach:
```python
class DynamicWeightedLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_tasks):
        super().__init__()
        # Learnable log variances for each task
        self.log_vars = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(num_tasks))
        
    def forward(self, losses):
        # losses: list of individual task losses
        weights = torch.exp(-self.log_vars)
        weighted_losses = [0.5 * torch.exp(-log_var) * loss + log_var 
                          for loss, log_var in zip(losses, self.log_vars)]
        return sum(weighted_losses)
```

## Future Improvements

### 1. Task-Specific Normalization
- Separate batch normalization layers for each task
- Allows tasks to learn their own feature statistics

### 2. Cross-Task Attention
- Add attention mechanisms between tasks
- Enable tasks to share information at the head level
- Reference: [Cross-Task Attention for Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02808)

### 3. Progressive Training
- Start with shared features
- Gradually introduce task-specific features
- Reference: [Progressive Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04671)
