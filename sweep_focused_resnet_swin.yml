description: |
  Focused sweep on ResNet34/50 and Swin Tiny with proven stable configurations.
  Emphasizes bottleneck_64 SNR layer (60% of runs) based on dominance in top results.
  Conservative LR range (1e-4 to 5e-4) to avoid 85% crash rate of 1e-3.
  Mandatory pretrained weights and smaller batch sizes for stability.
  Total combinations: 3 models × 5 SNR × 2 batch × 2 base_lr × 2 max_lr × 4 warmup = 480 possible configs

# Conservative early termination
early_terminate:
  type: hyperband
  min_iter: 10     # Give models time to stabilize
  max_iter: 30     # Reasonable checkpoint
  s: 2
  eta: 3

# Track best validation accuracy
