This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a modulation explainability research project that combines **enhanced multi-task learning** with perturbation-based explainability for Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC). The framework addresses both performance and interpretability challenges by transforming I/Q signal data into constellation diagrams and employing a ResNet-based architecture to simultaneously classify modulation schemes and predict discrete SNR values.

### Research Paper Context
This work was submitted as "Constellation Diagram Augmentation and Perturbation-Based Explainability for Automatic Modulation Classification" and introduces novel perturbation-based explainability techniques using the Perturbation Impact Score (PIS) metric to analyze critical regions in constellation diagrams that drive model decisions.
