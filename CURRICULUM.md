# Curriculum Learning for SNR Classification

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of curriculum learning for SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) classification in the constellation recognition system. The approach gradually increases the complexity of SNR classification tasks, starting with easily distinguishable extreme SNR values (-20dB, 30dB) and progressively introducing more challenging intermediate cases.

## Background
Curriculum learning, introduced by Bengio et al. [1], is a training strategy that presents examples in a meaningful order, from easier to more difficult. This approach has shown success in various domains, including:
- Natural language processing [2]
- Computer vision [3]
- Signal processing [4]

## Implementation Details

### 1. Curriculum Stages
```python
CURRICULUM_STAGES = [
    {'snr_list': [-20, 30]},                    # Stage 1: Extremes
    {'snr_list': [-20, -10, 10, 30]},          # Stage 2: Add 2 more
    {'snr_list': [-20, -14, -10, -6, 6, 10, 14, 30]},  # Stage 3: Add 4 more
    {'snr_list': [-20, -14, -10, -6, -2, 2, 6, 10, 14, 30]},  # Stage 4: Add 2 more
    {'snr_list': [-20, -14, -10, -6, -2, 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 30]}  # Stage 5: Add 1 more
]
```

### 2. Key Components

#### CurriculumManager Class
- Tracks current stage and SNR list
- Monitors validation SNR accuracy
- Implements patience-based plateau detection
- Manages stage transitions
- Maintains stage history

#### CurriculumAwareDataset Class
- Extends ConstellationDataset
- Dynamically filters data by current SNR values
- Preserves original data to efficiently switch between stages
- Maintains consistent labeling across stage transitions

#### Training Integration
- Optional feature via command-line flag (--use_curriculum)
- Configurable patience parameter (--curriculum_patience)
- Compatible with existing training pipeline
- WandB integration for tracking curriculum metrics

### 3. Stage Progression Logic

The system progresses through curriculum stages based on validation performance:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with extreme SNR values (-20dB, 30dB)
   - These values are the easiest to distinguish

2. **Progression Criteria**:
   - Track validation SNR classification accuracy
   - Detect performance plateaus when accuracy doesn't improve
   - Wait for `curriculum_patience` epochs of no improvement
   - Advance to next stage with more SNR values

3. **Dataset Updates**:
   - Dynamically update training and validation datasets
   - Filter to only include current stage's SNR values
   - Maintain consistent train/validation split

4. **Visualization**:
   - Highlight current curriculum SNRs in plots
   - Show confusion matrices specific to current stage
   - Track per-stage metrics in WandB

### 4. Monitoring and Evaluation

#### Metrics
- Per-stage SNR classification accuracy
- Validation loss trends during stage transitions
- Task weighting between modulation and SNR tasks
- Dataset size changes between stages

#### Logging
- Current curriculum stage and SNR list
- Epochs without improvement
- Stage transition events
- Performance impact of stage changes

## Usage

To enable curriculum learning:

```bash
python src/train_constellation.py --use_curriculum True --curriculum_patience 5
```

Optional parameters:
- `--use_curriculum`: Enable/disable curriculum learning (default: False)
- `--curriculum_patience`: Epochs without improvement before stage transition (default: 5)

## Advantages

The implemented curriculum learning approach provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Training Efficiency**: Focuses initially on easily distinguishable cases
2. **Better Generalization**: Gradually introduces harder examples as the model improves
3. **Reduced Catastrophic Forgetting**: Maintains extreme values in all stages
4. **Modular Design**: Can be enabled/disabled without code changes
5. **Compatibility**: Works with all model architectures (ResNet, Transformer, Swin)

## Future Work

Potential extensions:
1. Adaptive curriculum based on per-class performance
2. Dynamic patience adjustment based on stage difficulty
3. Integration with learning rate scheduling
4. Application to modulation classification tasks
