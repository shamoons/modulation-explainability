## Hierarchical Modulation Classification

### Overview
A two-stage hierarchical approach to modulation classification that first identifies the signal family (QAM, PSK, APSK, ASK, Special) and then classifies the specific modulation type within that family.

### Motivation
Current modulation classification treats all 20+ modulation types as independent classes, ignoring the natural hierarchical structure of modulation schemes. By leveraging the inherent relationships between modulation types within families, we can potentially improve classification accuracy and robustness.

### Proposed Architecture

#### Stage 1: Family Classification
- **Input**: Shared backbone features
- **Output**: 5 classes
  - QAM family
  - PSK family
  - APSK family
  - ASK family
  - Special cases (FM, GMSK)
- **Benefits**:
  - Simpler initial decision
  - More robust to noise
  - Reduces search space for final classification
  - Can use family-specific features

#### Stage 2: Family-Specific Classification
- **Input**: Family prediction + shared features
- **Family-specific heads**:
  - QAM head: 6 classes (16QAM to 256QAM)
  - PSK head: 6 classes (BPSK to OQPSK)
  - APSK head: 4 classes (16APSK to 128APSK)
  - ASK head: 3 classes (4ASK, 8ASK, OOK)
  - Special head: 2 classes (FM, GMSK)
- **Benefits**:
  - Simpler decision boundaries within families
  - More focused learning
  - Can use family-specific features
  - Reduced confusion between dissimilar modulation types

### Training Strategy

1. **Curriculum Learning**:
   - Start with family classification
   - Gradually introduce specific type classification
   - Use family prediction confidence to weight specific type loss

2. **Loss Function**:
   - Family classification loss
   - Family-specific classification loss
   - Combined loss with dynamic weighting
   - Potential addition of family similarity metrics

3. **Learning Rates**:
   - Different learning rates for different stages
   - Higher learning rate for family classification
   - Lower learning rate for specific type classification

### Potential Challenges

1. **Error Propagation**:
   - Wrong family prediction → wrong specific type
   - Need to handle ambiguous cases
   - Consider confidence thresholds

2. **Architecture Complexity**:
   - More parameters
   - More complex training process
   - Need for careful hyperparameter tuning

3. **Training Stability**:
   - Balance between family and specific type learning
   - Handle class imbalance within families
   - Manage gradient flow between stages

### Implementation Considerations

   - Current ResNet backbone could be maintained
   - Consider adding attention mechanisms between stages
   - Potential for family-specific feature extraction

2. **Training Pipeline**:
   - Two-phase training (family then specific)
   - Joint training with curriculum learning
   - Validation on both family and specific type accuracy

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Family classification accuracy
   - Specific type accuracy within families
   - Confusion matrices for both stages
   - Robustness to noise and channel conditions

### Future Directions

1. **Advanced Hierarchical Approaches**:
   - Multi-level hierarchy (e.g., QAM → Square QAM → 16QAM)
   - Attention mechanisms between levels
   - Knowledge distillation between stages

2. **Integration with SNR Prediction**:
   - Family-specific SNR prediction
   - Joint optimization of classification and SNR prediction
   - Hierarchical features for SNR estimation

3. **Robustness Improvements**:
   - Adversarial training for each stage
   - Family-specific data augmentation
   - Uncertainty estimation at each level
